- revisit exception handling when socket closes or half-closes
- make Connection owner a protocol (might need Python 3.6 though)
- strict timestamp parsing
- mechanism to enforce human readable ASCII on certain strings
- Sphinx and type hints
- required requests (restart)
- tidy up the rendering of the documentation: there are some issues
- check if mock_transport is going to be useful
- add unhandled_request method to server
- documentation for client
- provide a way to make local type registrations e.g. that are only applied to
  the current client/server (would also make it possible to use local state in
  the conversion e.g. to convert a name to the object with that name).
